# nw-diagnostics-python

> Utility files to help debug installations and environments for Python projects.

## Overview

The `nw-diagnostics-python` repository provides a set of diagnostic scripts and utilities designed to aid instructors, students, and developers in diagnosing and understanding their Python system setup.

## Getting Started

2. Identify and copy the desired local example file (e.g., `00_check_core.py` for basic checks or `00_check_env.py` for environment checks) to your local repository.
3. Run the copied script in your terminal.

## Directory Structure

- `basic`: Contains scripts that check basic system configurations for Python.
- `env`: Houses utilities to inspect Python's virtual environments and general settings.
- `external`: Utilities that inspect third-party or external Python dependencies.

## Caution

Some utilities, especially those in the `external` directory, execute code fetched from remote sources. Always ensure the sources are trusted and be aware of potential risks associated with executing such scripts.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to improve these utilities or add new ones. If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and use a feature branch. Pull requests are welcomed.
